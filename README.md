- /settings command - set per-channel defaults for supported options (_[see Notes](https://github.com/Kilvoctu/aiyabot#notes)!_):
  - also can set maximum steps limit and max batch count limit
  - refresh (update Marusya's options with any changes from Web UI)
- /identify command - create a caption for your image.
- /generate command - generate a prompt from text, using https://huggingface.co/Gustavosta/MagicPrompt-Stable-Diffusion
- /stats command - shows how many /draw commands have been used.
- /queue command - shows the size of each queue.
- /info command - basic usage guide, other info, and download batch images.
- /upscale command - resize your image.
- buttons - certain outputs will contain buttons.
  - 🖋 - edit prompt, then generate a new image with same parameters.
  - 🎲 - randomize seed, then generate a new image with same parameters.
  - 📋 - view the generated image's information.
  - ⬆️ - upscale the generated image with defaults. Batch grids require use of the drop downs
  - ❌ - deletes the generated image. In Live preview this button interrupts generation process
  - ➡️ - skips the current image generation in live preview and go to next batch (if there's more than 1)
- dropdown menus - batch images produce two drop down menus for the first 25 images.
  - The first menu prompts the bot to send only the images that you select at single images
  - The second menu prompts the bot to upscale the selected image from the batch.
- context menu options - commands you can try on any message.
  - Get Image Info - view information of an image generated by Stable Diffusion.
  - Quick Upscale - upscale an image without needing to set options.
  - Batch Download - download all images of a batch set without needing to specify batch_id and image_id
- mark image as spoiler
  - Per image (on `/draw`)
  - Set channel-wide default or force based on role with `/settings`
- [configuration file](https://github.com/Kilvoctu/aiyabot/wiki/Configuration) - can change some of Marusya's operational aspects. 


## Setup requirements

- Set up [AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion AI Web UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).
  - Marusya is currently tested on commit `cf2772fab0af5573da775e7437e6acdca424f26e` of the Web UI.
- Run the Web UI with API (`COMMANDLINE_ARGS= --api`).
- Clone this repo.
- Create a file in your cloned repo called ".env", formatted like so:
```dotenv
# .env
TOKEN = put your bot token here
```
- Run Marusya by running launch.bat (or launch.sh for Linux)

## Notes

- [See original wiki for notes on additional configuration.](https://github.com/Kilvoctu/aiyabot/wiki/Configuration)
- [See original wiki for notes on swapping models.](https://github.com/Kilvoctu/aiyabot/wiki/Model-swapping)
- [📋 requires a Web UI script. Please see original wiki for details.](https://github.com/Kilvoctu/aiyabot/wiki/Frequently-asked-questions-and-other-tips-(setup)#the--and-other-png-info-related-commands-are-not-working)
- Ensure Marusya has `bot` and `application.commands` scopes when inviting to your Discord server, and intents are enabled.
- As /settings can be abused, consider reviewing who can access the command. This can be done through Apps -> Integrations in your Server Settings. Read more about /settings [here.](https://github.com/Kilvoctu/aiyabot/wiki/settings-command)
- Marusya uses Web UI's legacy high-res fix method. To ensure this works correctly, in your Web UI settings, enable this option: `For hires fix, use width/height sliders to set final resolution rather than first pass`
