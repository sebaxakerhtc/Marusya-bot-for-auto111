## Setup requirements

- Set up [Automatic1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) or [AUTOMATIC1111's fork](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic).
- Run the Web UI as local host with API (`COMMANDLINE_ARGS= --api`).
- Clone this repo using `git clone -b main_en https://github.com/sebaxakerhtc/myaiyabot`
- Create a file in your cloned repo called ".env", formatted like so:
```dotenv
# .env
TOKEN = put your bot token here
```
- Run AIYA by running launch.bat (or launch.sh for Linux)

## Notes

- [See wiki for notes on additional configuration.](https://github.com/Kilvoctu/aiyabot/wiki/Configuration)
- [See wiki for notes on swapping models.](https://github.com/Kilvoctu/aiyabot/wiki/Model-swapping)
- Ensure AIYA has `bot` and `application.commands` scopes when inviting to your Discord server, and intents are enabled.
- As /settings can be abused, consider reviewing who can access the command. This can be done through Apps -> Integrations in your Server Settings. Read more about /settings [here.](https://github.com/Kilvoctu/aiyabot/wiki/settings-command)
- AIYA uses Web UI's legacy high-res fix method. To ensure this works correctly, in your Web UI settings, enable this option: `For hires fix, use width/height sliders to set final resolution rather than first pass`
